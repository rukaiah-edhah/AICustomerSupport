# AI Customer Support

This project is an AI-powered customer support application built using Next.js, JavaScript, Material UI, Vercel, Kinde, Supabase, and the Gemini API. 

## About

The app was built during our fellowship to learn how to develop products that improve customer interactions on any business site by providing intelligent, responsive support, thereby helping businesses maintain a high Net Promoter Score (NPS) through effective customer service.
